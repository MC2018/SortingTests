# SortingTests
A project worked on during my senior year of college allowing for benchmarking sorting algorithms with a variety of settings. It will then record how much time has elapsed in order to sort. The following settings are supported:
* SIZE: Set how large the dataset will be
* THRESHOLD: Switches the sorting algorithm used after a piece reaches a certain size
* ALTERNATE: Uses of shell sort and insertion sort based on the aforementioned threshold
* SEED: Makes the dataset determinate
* MULTITHREAD: Allows for multiple threads to run synchronously
* MEDIAN: Uses a median-of-3 sort before running each recursive quicksort
